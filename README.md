Run Vampire Run!

The little vampire is running away from the Cross. 

While running, he gets thirsty, so he needs to drink some blood to keep running. Drinking blood also gives him more energy to run faster. 

If he doesn't get any blood after a while, he cannot run anymore and of course, will get caught by the vampire (we don't want that!).

Also, the vampire doesn't like garlic, try to avoid them because if the vampire comes into contact with the garlic he will lose his precious blood and his speed is slower. Too much garlic, and he will get caught!!!
